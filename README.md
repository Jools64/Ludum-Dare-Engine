# Ludum-Dare-Engine
A little engine / framework / library thing for making small 2D games for Ludum Dare

This is a single file library that I quickly threw together over a few lunch breaks. I wouldn't recommend trying to use it. I haven't documented any of it, its in a semi-finished state and has some design issues. The collision detection literally only includes circle vs circle sweeps and rectangle overlaps and the rendering performance is bad because of the sort algorithm and use of canvas. I'm just putting it somewhere public in case I decide to participate in a Ludum Dare so I can use it and not be a big smelly cheater.
