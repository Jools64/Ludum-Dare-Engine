# Ludum-Dare-Engine
A little engine / framework / library thing for making small 2D games for Ludum Dare

I wouldn't recommend trying to use this right now, I haven't documented any of it and its in a semi-finished state with some major design flaws. It's also very basic in terms of collision detection, low performance and not robust enough for serious projects. I'm just putting it somewhere public in case I decide to participate in a Ludum Dare so I can use it and not be a big smelly cheater.
